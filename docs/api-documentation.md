# System Overview

The Universal Resolver is a name resolver that works with any decentralized
naming system.

## Terminology

Commonly-used terms in this document.

* DID: decentralized identifier
* DDO: DID descriptor object

## Architecture

[!System Architecture](/docs/figures/overview.png)

The universal resolver's main task is to provide an API wrapper around one or
more specific naming systems.  It does so by running a client for each system in
a colocated container or VM (bold boxes).  The "Service Orchestrator" is
responsible for spawning the required naming system clients, feeding them their
configuration data, and forwarding
HTTP requests to each of them (see below).

### Naming Service Clients

Naming service clients come in two flavors:  a lightweight client, and a full
node.  The difference between the two is that a full node will synchronize its
name state with a blockchain or distributed ledger, and host all the requisite
state (e.g. the chain state) and run all the requisite software (e.g. blockchain
peers) locally.  **This is a resource-intensive configuration, and is meant
primarily for dedicated servers.**

A lightweight client will instead contact a full node running on an external host.
The details as to which host to contact (and how to contact it) will be fed to the lightweight node's
container by the service orchestrator upon instantiation.  This configuration is
meant for devices that cannot reliably synchronize state with the naming
service, due to e.g. resource constraints and offline operating modes (such as
laptops and mobile phones).

The interface to both lightweight client and full node containers is identical.

## Protocol

[!Protocol](/docs/figures/protocol.png)

The universal resolver relies on its naming service clients to resolve
fully-qualified names or DIDs into DDOs.  It does this simply by forwarding requests it
receives to the requisite client, and caching the response.  **The HTTP headers in
the request will be used to determine whether or not to check the cache, and for
how long to cache the DDO response.**

The service orchestrator will forward the request to **at most one naming
service client.**.  It will choose which one based on the suffix of the name
(see below).

# API

## Resolver Interface

A single endpoint for the universal resolver is defined:  `GET /:versionString/identifiers/:fullyQualifiedNameOrDID`

* `:versionString` is the resolver API version.  For now, this is `1.0`.
* `:fullyQualifiedNameOrDID` is the fully-qualified name or DID to query.  This includes any/all indications of things like which system the name lives in, which blockchain the name is registered on, which namespace it lives in, and so on.

Examples:

* `GET /1.0/names/judecn.id.bsk` resolves `judecn.id` in Blockstackâ€™s virtualchain to a DDO.
* `GET /1.0/names/nickjohnson.eth.ens` resolves `nickjohnson.eth` using ENS to a DDO.
* `GET /1.0/names/did:sov:33ad7beb1abc4a26b89246` resolves the DDO for `did:sov:33ad7beb1abc4a26b89246` using Sovrin (`sov`).

### DIDs

A DID is a string that starts with `did:`.  If `:fullyQualifiedNameOrDID` starts
with `did:`, it will be treated as a DID _even if it is also a well-formed
name_.  The reason for this is to discourage the use of names that have an
ambiguous interpretation.

See [this
document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1rEPRjmRCwhLEfW7Cdwf-aGYXACqK-IFhD9o8bXaT6H0/edit#heading=h.yphg7n6k1rpo) for more details on resolving DIDs to DDOs.

### Fully-Qualified Names

Each name _must_ end in a '.' followed by a URL-safe suffix.  This suffix identifies the service that can resolve
the name.  This is similar in function to the method ID in a DID.  Anyone can
claim an identifier, provided that it is unique.

**Names _may not_ start with `did:`.**  This prefix is reserved for DIDs.

A name _must_ resolve to at most one DDO.  The service client _may_ do so by
first resolving the name to a DID, and then resolving the DID to a DDO.

Identifiers in use today:

* `.bsk`: for Blockstack-hosted names
* `.ens`: for ENS-hosted names
* ... (insert yours here)

## Service Client Interface

The service client interface has two endpoints, one for fully-qualified names
and one for DIDs.  The reason for two endpoints is that the service client _must
not_ be responsible for disambiguating an identifier string.  This
responsibility belongs only to the resolver.

The service client makes these endpoints available via HTTP.  The two endpoints are:

* A `names` endpoint: `GET /:versionString/names/:fullyQualifiedName`
* A `dids` endpoint: `GET /:versionString/dids/:DID`

A client _must_ implement at least one endpoint.  However, if it does not
implement an endpoint, it _must_ handle requests to it by returning `HTTP 501`.

Both endpoints return at most one DDO.  Implementations are encouraged, but not
required, to resolve the `:fullyQualifiedName` to a DID and then resolve the DID
to the DDO.

## Return Values

We are still waiting on a well-defined schema for a DDO, but the jist of the resolver's return value is that it is a compound object containing:

* the version string (matches `:versionString` in the request)
* the DDO identified by the fully-qualified name
* a catch-all `supplementary` object that provides service-specific hints to the client.

The `supplementary` field is for forward compatibility with future systems.  This is a field a service client can use to return something service-specific to clients (for example, Blockstack and ENS might want to give back the relevant transaction ID that created the DID).  If it is discovered that each client returns the same types of data in their `supplementary` fields, then we will standardize the response in a future version of this specification.

Schema (NOTE: missing precise DDO fields)
